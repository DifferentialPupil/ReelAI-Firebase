ReelAI Project Specification
============================

Overview:
---------
ReelAI reimagines a TikTok-like social video platform with an AI-first approach.
The project aims to streamline video creation, editing, and content discovery by integrating advanced AI features throughout the development process.
The focus is on delivering a complete end-to-end experience for one primary user type: either Content Creators or Content Consumers.

Key Features:
-------------
• Fully functional social video platform with video upload, processing, basic AI-assisted editing, playback, and social interaction (likes, comments, shares).
• Vertical slice development: Build complete features for a single user type (Content Creator or Content Consumer) before expanding.
• AI Augmentation: Integrate two substantial AI features to enhance user experience. Examples include:
   - For Creators (SmartEdit): Voice commands such as "remove awkward pause", "zoom on product", and "enhance lighting" to automatically edit videos.
   - For Consumers (SmartScan/PersonalLens): Capabilities like jumping to key segments, searching specific content details, and receiving personalized recommendations.

Core User Stories:
--------------------
For Content Creators:
  - "As a fitness coach, I want to add exercise timestamps to my workout videos."
  - "As a fitness coach, I want to tag videos with difficulty levels."
  - "As a fitness coach, I want to categorize videos by muscle group."

For Content Consumers:
  - "As a home cook, I want to save recipes by cuisine type."
  - "As a home cook, I want to filter videos by cooking time."
  - "As a home cook, I want to create collections of weeknight dinner ideas."

Technical Architecture:
-----------------------
• Firebase Ecosystem:
    - Firebase Authentication: For secure user sign-up and login.
    - Firebase Cloud Storage: To store and serve video and media assets.
    - Firestore: A real-time NoSQL database for managing metadata and user data.
    - Firebase Cloud Functions: To handle serverless backend logic and integrations with external APIs.
    - Firebase Generative AI: To drive advanced AI-enabled editing features.
    - Cloud Messaging: For real-time notifications.
    - Firebase Hosting: For reliable deployment of mobile components.

• Video Processing:
    - OpenShot Video Editing API: Provides video trimming, transitions, and automated editing workflows.

• Mobile Development:
    - Native development using Swift (iOS) or Kotlin (Android), ensuring deep integration with Firebase SDKs and other services.

Development Strategy:
---------------------
• Develop complete vertical slices that deliver an end-to-end user experience before integrating additional features.
• Prioritize building a robust workflow for video upload, processing, and publication.
• Iteratively integrate sophisticated AI functionalities to further enhance the platform—starting with core features, then augmenting with AI-assisted editing and smart content discovery.

Evaluation and Testing:
-----------------------
• Ensure thorough testing of both core functionalities and AI enhancements.
• Use iterative feedback mechanisms to refine AI features and overall user interactions.
